# Louis Pasteur Correspondance

## 1. Description of the Corpus
The corpus for this assignment is composed of twelve letters that Louis Pasteur[^1] sent to his family while he was a student at the Collège de Besançon in France from 1840 to 1842. The welve letters are specifically from january 1840 to june 1841. They are only the letters sent out by Pasteur, thus this is a corpus of outgoing correspondance which gives a partial insight into the epistolary exanched Pasteur had with his family. Nonetheless, this gives a very original insight into Pasteurs life, in our case as a student, his worries, his achievments, and all the little daily things that could happen in someones life in the 19th century. 

## 2. Target audience

### ***Historians of Science, Technology and Medicine*** 
For Historians of Science,Technology and Medicine the analysis of such a corpus has multiple utilities. Annotation and Name Entity Recognition can facilitate the identification of certain relationships, scientific collaboratoin for example. It can also give insight into Pasteur's scientific evolution over time. 

### ***Biographers*** 
For Biographers, the correpondance gives insights into more a personal aspects of Pasteur's life such as relationships, worries, challenges etc. The analysis makes it possible to identify key events or relationships and the letters can be contextualized in a broader historical framework. 


### ***Diachronic Linguists*** 
On a linguistic level, analyzing such a corpus is a way to gain insight into language evolution or communication style of Louis Pasteur for example. Furthermore if this corpus were to be studied in a comparativ aspect with another scientist of that time, a historical linguist coul do an analysis of and description of speech community (in this case the 19th century scientific community). Furthermore, cultural and social impact on language evolution for example. 


## 3. Text selection criteria
The text selected are the first year and a half available in the book "***Correspondance de Pasteur, 1840-1895. 1 / réunie et annotée par Pasteur Vallery-Radot***". Obviously this is not the the best way to select a Corpus, I wanted to make it larger by adding all the correspondance for the year 1841 at least but I encountered so many unexpected difficulties that I didn't have the time. The four volumes of the book actally cover the years 1840 to 1895, this is mainly why I decided to work on these texts, they have a lot of potential because the further we go in the years, the more the correspondance is diversified, he corresponds with other scientifcs and friends etc, which I think could be interesting to investgate. If the corpus was larger and more diversified, Pasteur's hypothetical style difference could be analyzed, when he corresponds with his family and his scientific peers. 

## 4. Collection Process and Processing
The afore mentioned book (the four volumes actually) are available on BnF Gallica which is the gigtal library of the French National Library. The books are freely downloadable and have been OCRized. Different format can be downloaded, PDF, TXT, or JPEG. I have deided to download the PDF version because I had some issue with the TXT format available. Thus, after downloading the PDF version, I have exported said PDF into TXT file using Acrobat Reader.
